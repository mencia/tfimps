Infinite Matrix Product States in TensorFlow

![](imps.png)

TensorFlow is used to optimize matrix product states directly in the infinite length limit. Initial applications to spin chains.

## Software

* TensorFlow
* Python 3.6.6
* Pymanopt

## Repository contents

* tfimps.py

It finds the ground state of an input Hamiltonian in the Stiefel manifold.

* test_tfimps.py

It runs the tests that were used to develop tfimps.py.
